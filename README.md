# Enable Native Player Controls for AWS Skillbuilder

## Installation

Since this is an open source chrome extension, I am not going to upload it to the marketplace, therefore you can be sure you are using this exact version of this code


### Steps

Clone or Download this repo

Navigate to 
```chrome://extensions```

Enable **Developer mode** ( up right corner ) 

and click **"Load Unpacked"** select downloaded project

**It will be running only when you click extension's icon**
